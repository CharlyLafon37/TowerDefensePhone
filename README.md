# TowerDefensePhone

App written by Charly Lafon.

## Deployment

- First go to app/src/main/java/td/ez/com/towerdefense/network/SocketSingleton.java and replace the IP address by your server's IP address (server running the Tower-Defense-Server project). 
- Then since the app isn't published on a store, you will have to either : build the .apk with Android Studio (Build > Build APK(s)) then publish it on the desired phones, or plug your phones on your computer and run the app from Android Studio.
